# Planning Skill – Bronze Tier

When processing a task:

1. **Objective**: Restate the task in one sentence
2. **Steps**: Create a numbered or checkbox list of logical next actions
3. **Status**: Set to "complete" when plan is written

Format the output exactly as:

```markdown
---
objective: [one sentence restating the task]
status: complete
---

## Steps
- [ ] Step one
- [ ] Step two
- [ ] Step three
```

Rules:
- The objective MUST be a single, clear sentence
- Steps MUST use Markdown checkbox syntax (`- [ ]`)
- Include at least 2 concrete, actionable steps
- Steps should be specific enough to execute without further clarification
- Set status to "complete" once the plan is fully written
